# libft
This is my own library from the 42 school common core. It is my own costumised set of functions in C that I use in more advanced projects at school.
If you have any doubts on how any of the functions work, there is documentation in each file.

## printf
I have also added to this repository my costumized version of the function printf, built by me tring to replicate some of the features of the original printf of stdio.h

## get_next_line
In this repository there is also a set of functions that read from an input file descriptor line by line. This was another project from 42 school but I decided to add it to my library since it is so usefull.
